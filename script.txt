01L: Hey, Gus! You know, I was just thinking—did I ever tell you about the time I escaped from Alcatraz?
02G: Yeah, Larry. Yesterday, twice. And last week. And the week before that.
03L: Ah, but did I ever tell you about the time I broke out using nothing but a toothbrush and some dental floss?
04G: Oh, this should be good. Enlighten me.
05T: Uh, hi! Is this 13 Creepy Dungeon Way?
06G: What the—who are you, and why are you here?
07T: I’m Tina, from Tina’s Pizza Palace! I got an order for, uh… “L. Escapist?”
08L: That’s me! I told you I had connections. Pizza deliveries right to my cell!
09G: You ordered a pizza? You’re a prisoner! You can’t just—
10T: Extra large with pepperoni and jalapeños. Paid in full. Here you go!
11L: See, Gus? Told you I’ve got friends on the outside.
12G: Yeah, right. What did you trade this time? Your invisible Rolex? Or maybe your “treasure map” to the Fountain of Youth?
13L: Why, Gus, you wound me. Can’t a guy just enjoy some pizza without all the accusations?
14T: So… this is a weird place for a pizza delivery, huh?
15L: Oh, it’s just temporary. I’m getting out tomorrow. My lawyer, uh, Abraham Lincoln, is sorting it out.
16T: Abraham Lincoln? Isn’t he, like, dead?
17G: Don’t even try, Tina. This guy could convince you the sky is green if you listen long enough.
18T: So… do I leave the pizza here, or…?
19G: You leave it with me. No way Larry’s getting his greasy hands on this.
20L: Hey, Gus, I’ll trade you! How about that Swiss bank account I mentioned last week?
21G: How about you trade me some peace and quiet?
22T: So, are you really getting out tomorrow?
23L: Tomorrow? Nah, I’m busting out tonight. With nothing but this pizza crust and a paperclip. You should stick around—might be worth a slice!
24G: Here. Just don’t choke on it.
25L: Thanks, Gus! You’re all heart, you know that?
